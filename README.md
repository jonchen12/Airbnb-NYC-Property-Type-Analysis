# Airbnb-NYC-Property-Type-Analysis
Objectives:
The goal of this project was to analyze Airbnb listings in New York City (NYC) to uncover valuable business insights regarding property types, pricing strategies, and revenue trends. Key business questions answered include:
- Which property types generate the highest revenue in NYC?
- What is the pricing trend across different property types and the number of bedrooms?
- How do customer preferences for specific property types and locations affect occupancy and pricing?
- Where are Airbnb listings most concentrated in NYC, and what patterns can be identified in high-demand areas?

What I did in Tableau:
In this project, I utilized Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that provide insights into Airbnb data. The key actions I took include:
- Created a tree map to visualize total revenue generated per property type, identifying the most lucrative categories.
- Built a horizontal bar graph to show the average price per property type and compare pricing across different property categories.
- Designed a heat map of listings to visualize geographic concentrations of Airbnb properties across NYC neighborhoods.
- Developed text tables to highlight the number of listings per property type and the average number of bedrooms per property type.
- Created a bar graph to explore the correlation between average price and the number of bedrooms, providing insights into how property size impacts pricing.
- Analyzed the number of listings per bedroom category using another text table to assess trends in property availability based on bedroom count.

Summary Findings:
Revenue Breakdown: "Entire rental unit" and "Private room in rental unit" together account for approximately 50% of Airbnb's total revenue in NYC.
Revenue Trends: Property types like "entire condos" and "entire townhouses" typically have higher average prices, highlighting potential opportunities for property owners to focus on these categories.
Pricing Insights: Larger properties with more bedrooms generally have higher nightly rates, though pricing strategies can differ across neighborhoods.
Geographic Distribution: Airbnb listings are most concentrated in areas such as the Lower East Side of Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, particularly in neighborhoods like Williamsburg.
Market Demand: There is strong demand for mid-range properties (1-2 bedrooms) in popular tourist areas, suggesting that property investors and Airbnb hosts should prioritize this segment to optimize occupancy and revenue.
